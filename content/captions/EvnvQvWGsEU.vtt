00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.100
There is an urgent need to replace
fossil-based raw materials –

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.130
with renewable, biobased alternatives.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.010
Foam forming is one of the
most potential technologies –

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.000
for manufacturing biobased products.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.030
It improves the material and
energy efficiency of the process –

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.030
expands the range of usable raw materials –

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.110
and enables the production of new,
value-added and high-performing structures.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.170
VTT offers piloting platforms for foambased
material development and scale-up.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.150
These platforms enable the development of
novel recyclable and sustainable materials –

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.100
for packaging and construction,
lightweight boards, wipes, filters –

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.240
and hygiene products with only small
modifications needed to current production lines.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.040
Will this technology
and VTT’s expertise –

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.230
be your avenue to biobased
material innovations?
