Co-creation is key in creating inclusive and
end-user oriented technologies and services.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.120
Our co-creation space is a 360 degree space,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.050
in which scoping human factors of future-oriented
projects are made easy, immersive and exciting.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.110
Consisting of six video projectors, our co-creation
space provides an authentic experience of space

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.100
which is particularly beneficial
in facilitating user groups

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.070
and designing user-oriented
services and future technologies.
