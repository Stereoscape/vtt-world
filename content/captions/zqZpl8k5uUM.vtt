00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.060
Located in Otaniemi, Finland, –

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.180
Micronova features the largest R&D
cleanroom in the Nordic countries.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.230
It is part of OtaNano
and operated jointly –

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.210
by VTT and Aalto university.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.040
The cleanroom has processing
capabilities for silicon-based CMOS, –

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.060
MEMS and photonics devices,
3D integration and thin film components.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.190
Here, close to 350
world-class experts –

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.210
develop innovative
enabling technologies –

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.230
and apply them to practical
micro- and nanosystems.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.110
In Micronova, we work on new sensors,
detectors, photonics components, –

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.010
passive RF components,
PMUTs and other MEMS devices, –

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.090
as well as state-of-the-art
quantum devices.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.050
We also have laboratories
for characterization –

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.180
and system level
demonstration.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.130
At Micronova, VTT can offer its
customers and partners –

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.180
the entire
development cycle –

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.020
from fundamental research
and process development –

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.020
to prototyping and
small-scale production.
