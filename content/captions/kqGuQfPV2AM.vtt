00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:11.150
Reliable and high performance ships play an
important role to ensure safe and sustainable sea traffic.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.170
We develop reliable and energy-efficient
shipping solutions with our customers.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.150
Our facilities include a
towing tank of 130m in length.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:33.080
Ship performance and safe operation
limits are validated with model tests.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.150
Our ship handling simulator is utilized for research
in ship manoeuvrability and smart ship operations.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:46.000
Long term monitoring onboard reveals the
true loads faced by the vessels in harsh conditions.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.180
We conduct sea and ice trials to verify
ship performance and energy efficiency.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.010
With the help of technology innovations,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.220
we contribute significantly to lower the greenhouse
gas emissions of shipping to half by 2050.
