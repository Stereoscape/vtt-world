WEBVTT

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.020
We need smart ways of ensuring the
sustainable use of our natural resources.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.200
VTT is an expert in turning virgin
or recycled raw materials –

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.130
and industrial side streams into
new products made of biomass.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.060
Processing biomass into industrially feasible
intermediates is the crucial first step –

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.240
in ensuring the creation of new
valuable bio-based products.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.200
VTT provides strong competence
and multipurpose facilities.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.160
Our offering includes technology co-development
and scale-up for future biorefineries.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.120
We develop safe and ecological
regenerated fibre production concepts

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.080
Our know-how includes the engineering of alternative
methods for tailored nanocellulose qualities –

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.240
as well as advanced lignin recovery
and application technologies.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.200
We also offer many approaches for developing
sustainable packaging solutions.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.010
Our strong expertise in the
3D printing of biomaterials –

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.070
offers a novel way of
making customised products.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.030
Could these unique pilots and expertise
offer you a fast track from R&D to production?
