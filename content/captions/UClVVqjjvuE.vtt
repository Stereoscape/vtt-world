00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:11.130
Microelectronics are the key enablers of nearly
every product or service that we use daily.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.120
In a car, hundreds of
integrated circuits, –

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.070
sensors and micro-electromechanical
systems keep us safe.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.110
Our smartphones feature –

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.110
tens of microelectronic
components and sensors.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:36.110
At VTT, we research and develop microelectronic
components at the Micronova facility.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.000
We innovate micro-electro-mechanical systems,
photonic integrated circuits, –

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.170
application specific integrated circuits,
hyperspectral solutions, –

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.020
as well as work with quantum
solutions and 2D materials.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.110
Micronova serves as a central hub for
the Finnish microelectronics industry, –

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.120
bringing together experts working
on similar kinds of challenges.
