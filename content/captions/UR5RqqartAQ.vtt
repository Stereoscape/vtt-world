00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.150
Digitalization and AI help us speed up
the development of process technologies.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.100
By modelling the processes, we can get more information
and understanding during process development.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:25.050
Utilising AI and digital twins
helps us reduce the risks, –

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.000
time and money spent in traditional
steps of process development.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.200
With process design and feasibility studies,
computational fluid dynamics, –

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.150
hybrid simulation and modelling, new
bioprocesses can be upscaled –

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.150
and made commercially viable
faster than ever before.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.070
In the future, AI offers a whole new
potential to chemical engineering.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.240
More automated research
process means more –

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.190
and new types of information at
same amount of time and resources –

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.090
and removes the boundaries
of traditional experimental R&D.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.240
This opens the way for
finding entirely new solutions .
