00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.000
The increasing global demand
for plastic coincides –

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.030
with the need to solve the plastic waste challenge.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.059
We are rethinking materials
and material cycles –

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.120
to help find solutions to these big questions.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.150
There are several good alternatives
for sustainable solutions.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.040
We see a lot of potential in existing plastic
waste as valuable raw material.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.040
Our unique VAREX pilot line provides
adaptive processing control for recyclates.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.070
This enables upgrading recycled plastics
to be used in high-value applications.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.190
In addition, new bio-based and
biodegradable plastics and composites –

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.220
provide new opportunities to fulfil global material needs.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.090
We research and develop new thermoplastic
materials for various applications.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.170
This involves the valorisation of recycled plastics –

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.150
as well as the creation of
high-performance biocomposites.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.200
Material design is a crucial step when
enabling the circular economy of plastics.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.030
Our multiple piloting capabilities and expertise –

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.200
enable the creation of a wide variety of
novel materials for numerous applications.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.120
We bring together multidisciplinary teams –

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.170
to ensure the functionality of applications
while meeting circular economy requirements.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.090
Plastic will continue to be an extremely
important material in the future.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.030
We help our customers to transform their
businesses to match global sustainability ambitions.
