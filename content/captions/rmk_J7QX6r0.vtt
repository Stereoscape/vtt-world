00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.100
Digitalisation is increasing and
expanding to new applications, –

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.050
while wireless capacity for
ransferring data is improving.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.230
Enhancing the reliability
and efficiency of –

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.130
telecommunication systems
are top priorities for VTT.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.080
We have a unique and adaptable
network and test environment.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.020
Our strengths lie in network
management, resource optimisation, –

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.050
and vertical industry
understanding.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.000
We develop the field through
R&D projects with our customers –

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.210
and international
partnerships.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.170
Our test network includes 5G, LTE,
non-terrestrial and IoT networks, –

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.130
serving the sectors of
space, cyber security, –

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.100
and public authorities.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.050
Advanced applications and services
are developed in our test network, –

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.010
for example, for autonomous vehicles,
industrial systems, healthcare, –

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.220
smart energy, and
critical infrastructures.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.190
We have skilled experts and
versatile facilities and tools.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.140
Energy efficiency, awareness and
sustainability goals guide our work –

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.100
towards smart networks
and services of the future.
