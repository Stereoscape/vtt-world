00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.400
Within the ongoing energy revolution
towards smart grids and renewables,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.400
advanced technologies are required
to ensure the safety and reliability

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.200
of power distribution,
protection and control.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.383
Evolving 5G technology

00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:22.600
provides a foundation for new grid applications
and services to be developed.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.127
By interconnecting devices
through secure,

00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:30.160
reliable and low-latency
wireless communication infrastructure,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.280
the design and operation of smart
grids will reach a new dimension.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.693
One of the most demanding communication-based
protection principle is line-differential protection.

00:00:42.694 --> 00:00:45.620
Distributed along the medium voltage line

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.280
relays exchange measurements
of current with each other.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.375
All the relays compare the values
independently,

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.520
alarm in case of differences,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.480
and initiate the de-energization
of the line section due to fault.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.848
Traditionally, locating the faults on the line
has required heavy amounts of manual labor,

00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:08.760
causing power outages to last a long time.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.080
With centralized fault location,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.800
the problems can be located in seconds.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.526
Cost-effective merging units
along the power line

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:19.760
publish the digitized
voltage and current measurements

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.667
to the centralized smart substation devices,

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:27.920
which compute the fault location
and initiate the required actions.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.904
To ensure reliable energy supply,
flexibility is essential in maintaining

00:01:32.904 --> 00:01:38.640
the balance between variable
renewable generation and consumption.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.621
A new method utilizes telecommunication
network multicast services

00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:45.497
in transferring control messages

00:01:45.497 --> 00:01:50.000
to a large amount of geographically
scattered devices in distribution grids.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.600
This can provide short response times

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.880
and flexible deployment
of demand response control.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.240
Safe transition towards utilization

00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:03.720
of modern wireless communication
technologies in critical power systems

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.545
require years of studies,
prototyping and testing.

00:02:07.546 --> 00:02:10.400
In Otaniemi, we have built a pilot environment

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:15.457
for testing 5G networks in power
system protection and control.

00:02:15.457 --> 00:02:21.184
Our testbed contains relays,
merging units and smart substation devices,

00:02:21.184 --> 00:02:24.480
supplemented by video
and sensor equipment.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.200
A real-time simulator enables emulating
various power system architectures and fault scenarios.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.249
Our 5G test network, advanced commercial
mobile networks in the area,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.800
and multipoint quality-of-service
measurement system with various

00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:43.760
traffic generation and shaping
possibilities provide a platform

00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:48.560
for testing communication applications
under realistic conditions.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.560
The pilot environment enables developing
new edge and AI solutions,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.480
as well as hybrid testing of grid
and communication components in their

00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:02.680
prototype phase, bringing cost
savings to product development.
