00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.090
New methods and science-based
innovations are essential in

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.170
minimising the local and global
emissions of vehicles.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.210
Especially now as new technologies
are entering the market,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.240
their impact must be studied

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.000
to understand the path
towards a cleaner future.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.080
VTT’s excellence and expertise
enable our partners and customers

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.240
to develop further
fuel concepts,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.090
energy efficient internal
combustion engines,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.000
vehicle performance, and exhaust
after-treatment systems.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.150
We enhance new
low emission concepts

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.040
that increase engine
and vehicle efficiency.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.120
We develop flexible solutions
with our vast know-how

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.200
of carbon neutral energy and
low emission options

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.120
from fuels, engines and
emission control systems

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.220
to the in-depth
characterisation of emissions.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.010
With our capacity
building projects,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.010
we help our clients
to improve their skills

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.050
regarding emission measurements.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.060
For VTT, the premise of
measurement is always reliability

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.070
without reliable measurements,
we are not able to create

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.020
solutions necessary for reducing emissions.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.060
In our laboratory facilities,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.070
we have all the necessary infrastructure

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.100
for studying and measuring emissions,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.200
including engine dynamometers
for high-speed engines,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.030
test benches for exhaust gas
after-treatment systems

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.040
and vehicle test facilities.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.220
From controlled environments
to field simulations,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.160
from passenger cars to trucks,
and power plants to ships,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.170
we have the required
equipment to study and develop

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.180
technologies for measuring and
reducing engine emissions.
