00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.120
Smart energy
plays a key role –

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.010
in securing a clean,
Low-carbon future.

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:13.000
We must quickly cut down
carbon dioxide emissions –

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.000
from energy production.

00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:17.015
Finland's target is
that by 2030 –

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:20.759
more than 55% of energy use
will be based on renewable energy.

00:00:22.027 --> 00:00:24.119
Increasing the use of
renewable energy requires –

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.111
a flexible power grid
that supports decentralised –

00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:28.455
energy generation and
enables a steady energy supply.

00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:30.073
We want to give consumers
a smart grid that is: –

00:00:30.076 --> 00:00:33.080
sustainable, reliable,
flexible and affordable.

00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:38.437
Why test this new kind of
a power grid in Finland?

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.578
Finland has an
open energy market.

00:00:40.578 --> 00:00:44.050
We already use the
latest technology.

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:47.050
Smart Otaniemi is an open
testing environment for –

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.016
new ideas and collaborations.

00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:55.019
The ecosystem of 60+ partners
is working hard –

00:00:56.007 --> 00:01:01.020
to enable climate neutral
cities by 2030.

00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:05.020
Smart Otaniemi partner network
creates innovations and utilizes –

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.013
state-of-the-art research.

00:01:08.014 --> 00:01:13.010
We are piloting new solutions
and business models.

00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:19.837
Intelligent electric
car charging solutions.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.017
Neighbourhood hybrid energy systems.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:32.025
World's cleanest waste collections.

00:01:34.022 --> 00:01:39.015
And many other new ideas!

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:43.050
Let's make smart energy come true!
