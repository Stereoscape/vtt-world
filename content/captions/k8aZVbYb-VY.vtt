00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.660
Regulations for exhaust emissions are tightening and customer
requirements for energy efficiency is increasing.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.700
This incurs need for more efficient catalysts and higher
quality fuels and lubricants.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.140
And a need for improved emission measurement
and monitoring techniques.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.500
Testing these for large scale engines in real applications
is both expensive and slow.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.700
Until now.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.060
VTT has launched a test bench in Otaniemi, Finland.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.700
This test bench can simulate real exhaust
gas conditions with unprecedented accuracy.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.140
VTT test bench offers your product development an opportunity –

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.780
to perform realistic hardware testing –
in laboratory conditions.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.860
Bringing testing accuracy, faster completion rates
and flexibility to your product development.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.660
And with ten times lower cost compared
to the current testing methods.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.260
We're ready for the next project.
