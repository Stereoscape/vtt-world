00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.040
Automation of repetitive tasks
reduces the need for manual labor.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.090
The research topic of robotics includes
various disciplines such as mechanical design,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:22.020
mechatronics, control systems, machine vision,
software development, IoT and machine learning.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.090
In our robotics lab, we focus on
programming and mechatronic systems.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.150
We study and implement mobile
robots that are fully autonomous,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.140
smart vehicles that are best suited
for labor-intensive routine tasks.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.130
We are also implementing robotics
for industrial production purposes

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.080
and studying social robotics in
service industry and in health care.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.090
The future aim is to develop new
intelligent technologies by fusing together

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.080
AI-based control algorithms with
novel robot kinematics and mechanics.
