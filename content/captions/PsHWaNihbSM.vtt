00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.200
One of the greatest challenges
of humankind –

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.200
is the sufficiency of materials
in a world of decreasing resources.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.400
VTT’s extensive know-how can
help you in creating innovations, –

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.800
improving resource efficiency and
developing recycling concepts.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.120
Our expertise lies in the
thorough understanding –

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.200
of metallurgical unit processes
and their development, –

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.400
in addition to our knowledge
on the behaviour of ores, –

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.480
concentrates
and secondary raw materials.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.520
Making the most of raw materials
and side streams, –

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.600
VTT develops concepts
for the circular economy, –

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.680
including the separation
of metals from plastics, –

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.080
and processes that minimise
waste streams and the use of water.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.200
Batch and continuous
metallurgical experiments –

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.200
are run with our automatically controlled flexible pilot system, FLEXMET.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.000
It is part of VTT’s comprehensive
Bioruukki pilot facilities.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.080
FLEXMET can be extended and scaled
to meet a variety of customer needs.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.120
In addition, our in-house
analytical services –

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.280
enable real-time monitoring
of processes.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.240
Partner with us to create
sustainable business opportunities –

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.560
and to join both Finnish and
international innovation networks.
