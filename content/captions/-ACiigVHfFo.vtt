00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.400
Clean air is needed everywhere –

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.120
in public spaces, homes,
offices and factories.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.130
As fine particles cause lung diseases,
heart problems and cancer, –

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.880
it is essential to reduce
emissions at their source, –

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.700
or use advanced supply
and indoor air filtration

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.490
to improve air quality
and reduce health hazards.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.750
Clean air is also needed in securing
various industrial processes.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.800
VTT has the knowhow of
airborne contamination control –

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.930
and the facilities to simulate,
test and verify hypotheses –

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.380
about air quality, and sustainable
methods to improve it.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.380
We are at the forefront of R&D
into new solutions, –

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.830
working with international clients
in multidisciplinary teams.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.550
In addition to R&D, VTT provides
education and expert services,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.380
different filter testing
and test systems, –

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.130
portable air cleaner
performance evaluation –

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.850
and other tailored analyses.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.500
Our work is a research based,
hands on effort –

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.200
to improve air quality,
everywhere.
