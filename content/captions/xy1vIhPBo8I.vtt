00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.040
Silicon photonics (SiPh) refers
to the generation, manipulation,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.090
guiding and using light in
Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs).

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:22.020
These circuits are processed on the surface of
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers in a similar way -

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.090
as microelectronic circuits are fabricated
for processing electrical signals.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.150
PICs are like electronic circuits, but propagating
optical instead of electrical signals.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.140
The main application areas for Si photonics are:
Optical communication, and computing for ICT.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.100
Military & Aerospace

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.080
Autonomous systems and LIDARs

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.080
Manufacturing and Industry 4.0

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.040
Health care and medical imaging

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.090
Conventional thin-SOI waveguides have strong
polarization and wavelength dependency.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.040
Only Thick-SOI waveguides offer ultra-broad
bandwidth and polarization independency.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.030
The benefits of VTT’s Thick-SOI technology are:
low loss, dense integration, ultra-wide bandwidth,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.110
small polarization dependency and
insensitivity to fabrication variations.
