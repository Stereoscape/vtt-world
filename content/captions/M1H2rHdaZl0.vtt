WEBVTT

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:11.110
VTT’s micromodules are developed in cleanrooms
equipped for advanced integration –

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.150
and packaging of photonics
and electronics components.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:25.030
VTT’s researchers develop new
manufacturing and integration technologies –

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.080
for advanced photonics and millimetre-wave modules.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.210
Functional components and modules
are assembled from chips and microsystems.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.240
The centre’s main processes involve
multilayer ceramics (LTCC), –

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.040
hybrid integration, assembly and packaging.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.070
VTT’s micromodules are used
especially in communications, –

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:06.090
sensing and in applications
designed for harsh environments.
