00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.040
Electric vehicles and powerful new
battery technologies are transforming –

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.000
both the transportation and energy industries.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.140
Whether fully electric, hybrid or plug-in hybrid design, –

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.180
electrification is the key technology
in reducing harmful emissions –

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.060
from vehicles and mobile machinery.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.110
VTT works together with its clients in researching
and developing new battery technologies –

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.240
and electrification methods.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.020
We have the research facilities and experience
in electrification research that enable –

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.070
comprehensive experimental work
on battery cells, modules and packs, –

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.170
as well as BMS development to improve
electrical and thermal management.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.220
In our laboratory, we can test battery
behaviour under various operating conditions, ––

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.190
for example, finding an
optimal approach for its cooling.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.240
By improving the electricity
storage in batteries, –

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.030
we can make also stationary energy
storage systems more viable –

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.000
and sustainable than ever before.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.040
Our facilities support a wide
range of experimental work –.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.080
from electric motors and engines
to drivetrains and complete vehicles.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.120
Whether light or heavy duty, the performance
of electric vehicles can be measured.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.190
In addition to experimental testing, we have
extensive modelling and simulation capacities.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.010
We create digital models of
batteries and other components, –

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.160
enabling us to carry out simulations
without the need to build prototypes.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.230
The models enable also
hardware-in-the-loop testing.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:12.030
We are especially proud of the VTT Smart eFleet,
a validated system-level simulation environment –

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.120
capable of modelling electric
vehicle fleet operations, –

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.210
ranging from electric underground
mining to city bus operations, –

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.050
and from system planning to
operation-based digital-twin applications.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:32.020
Simulations provide important information
for reducing total costs and harmful emissions, –

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.110
or optimising systems
with digital-twin solutions.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.200
However, a useful simulation
tool requires validation.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.040
A wide range of VTT research
facilities have been utilized –

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.000
in the design of the VTT Smart eFleet
to produce as accurate results as possible.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.170
A wide range of solutions are needed
for the electrification of transport.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.070
VTT’s expertise and facilities enable development
work together with our clients and partners.
