electronics manufacturing –

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.000
enables the integration of
electronics into surfaces –

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.000
such as plastics and bio-based
or biodegradable materials, –

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.320
creating intelligent products that
have never been seen before.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.000

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.400
lightweight,
and stretchable.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.000
We have unique in-house competence
from material formulation –

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.600
and process development of
pilot-scale roll-to-roll production –

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.200
to multi-technological knowledge
of applications and systems.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.520
VTT’s world-class pilot factory
for printing, component assembly –

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.840
and post processing enables
upscaling the production process –

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.280
and provides proof
of manufacturing.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.880
Our roll-to-roll production process
offers high throughput, –

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.000
cost-efficiency
and upscalability.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.080
Our post processing
services include overmolding, –

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.240
lamination, laser cutting
and testing.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.240
With over 20 years of experience
and over 100 experts, –

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.240
we can help our
