00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.560
Chemistry is a key enabler for a
circular economy & resource efficiency.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.320
The VTT Sustainable Chemistry platform
supports customers in developing –

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.200
effective and climate-friendly
chemical products and processes.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.680
We help in turning complex feeds,
such as CO2, biomasses and wastes, –

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.000
into new value added products
with chemistry tools.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.080
Our R&D infrastructure -
from lab to pilot scale -

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.600
supports the development of innovations
and new business opportunities.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.680
We offer testbeds for
catalyst development and –

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.760
chemical and
polymer synthesis.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.800
Our expertise covers chemical
conversion technologies, –

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.800
downstream processing,
process modelling and –

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.560
techno-economical assessment.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.680
We help our customers use cutting-edge
chemistry for sustainable growth.
