00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.360
when preparing for self-driving vehicles we need 
to ensure that the instruments aiming to replace  

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.520
human senses are able to generate equally fast 
reactions intelligence as we humans have is needed  

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.160
ultra fast 5g together with its g5 connectivity 
enables smart communication between vehicles  

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.400
and novel real-time services increasing the 
vehicle's intelligence and situational awareness  

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:43.840
let's see how it works data from the 
sensors of the car is sent to an mec server

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.000
the data is then analyzed and processed locally  

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.840
warnings and information are sent 
back to cars traveling in the area

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.280
accurate and real-time data is the oil of the 
intelligence for quick decision making of the  

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:26.000
vehicle steering commands and for safety vtt is 
the hub for developing revolutionary solutions  

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:44.560
for broadband and time-critical 5g connectivity 
edge computing and vehicle applications you
