00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.150
Hydrogen economy is an opportunity
for industries to transition —

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.220
towards more sustainable,
low-carbon processes.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:19.120
Hydrogen can be utilised as a fuel in
power production and transportation, —

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:26.020
for seasonal energy storage and
long-distance transportation of energy.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.049
Especially in so-called
Power-to-X applications —

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:38.100
hydrogen’s commercial potential is
already recognised around the world.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.030
At VTT, we research and develop
fuel cell concepts, power production —

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.210
and technologies that utilise hydrogen.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.140
We manage a fully automated research
infrastructure available for 24/7 operation.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.070
In addition to modelling, testing
and characterisation possibilities, —

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.110
our laboratories offer testing and
characterisation services for fuel cells, –

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.160
fuel cell stacks as well as
electrolyser testing services.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.110
We are designing complete fuel cell
systems of up to several kilowatts –

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.030
and electrolysers to produce clean hydrogen.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.060
Excellent hardware technology and
experimental knowhow about the FC&H2 domain —

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.100
are essential in creating economically viable
and environmentally sustainable solutions.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.000
We at VTT are proud to have
what it takes to research —

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.100
and develop the solutions of tomorrow.
