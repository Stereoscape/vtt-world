00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:10.150
In the near future, sustainable food
systems cater individual wellbeing.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.230
Plant and cellular agriculture
based food innovations –

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.040
will reduce animal protein consumption
which in turn helps tackle climate change.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.120
We further believe that by 2035,
agile food systems that enable –

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.200
personalised food manufacturing and eating
services are a natural part of our society.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.010
That is why we support our partners in
discovering new food and beverage solutions –

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.080
to promote prosperity
for people and businesses.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.140
We have the infrastructure and knowhow
especially in cereal technology –

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.210
and biotechnology to renew
and improve food processes, –

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.020
for example by enabling the use
of side-streams as food materials.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.080
Our labs and pilot-scale processing
and analytical facilities are complemented –

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.140
with our expertise in raw materials,
end-product design and consumer insight.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.200
For promoting wellbeing via eating,
we explore innovative solutions, –

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.010
for example by developing new personalised
on-the-go food concepts and machinery.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.080
Let's create the new era
of food systems, together.
