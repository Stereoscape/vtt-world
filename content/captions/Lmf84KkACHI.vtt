WEBVTT

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.100
Biotechnology will disrupt the way we
produce materials, chemicals and food, –

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.180
while also enabling them to be
created from renewable sources.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.100
At VTT, we work in multidisciplinary
teams and in close collaboration –

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.580
with our clients in creating
sustainable industrial solutions.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.100
We create cell factories that, for example,
produce the desired cell biomass, –

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.660
chemicals and proteins for enzyme,
food and pharmaceutical applications.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.100
Our expertise extends to synthetic
biology that enables the design of –

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.220
genetic codes of organisms
for different needs.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.880
Synthetic DNA can be
incorporated into the microbe –

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.720
to create increasingly
efficient production organisms.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.280
We have automated systems
for investigating a wide variety –

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.680
of conditions that are needed
to achieve high performing yields.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.100
In order to scale up the production
of chemicals and proteins, –

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.740
we focus on the research at our
state-of-the art piloting facilities.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.720
Let’s work together to innovate
new solutions for the bioeconomy.
