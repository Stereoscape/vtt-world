00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.100
Reliable and accurate measurements
are vital for global industry, –

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.050
commerce and safety.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.070
Future power generation
and industrial processes –

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.230
require new measurement
solutions as they help –

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.180
in reaching goals
related to climate change.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.120
New technologies to
identify materials –

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.170
and measure their qualities
benefit the circular economy.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.200
VTT MIKES, the National
Metrology Institute of Finland, –

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.210
develops new measurement
and calibration technologies.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.170
We are responsible for the
implementation and development –

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.090
of the national measurement
standards system.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.050
Our fields of expertise include
interferometry, –

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.070
high voltage measurements,
optical spectroscopy, –

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.010
hyperspectral sensing technology
and quantum measurement standards.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.020
Our laboratories feature a wide
range of equipment –

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.190
for providing the most accurate
measurements and calibrations, –

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.120
ranging from interferometers
and optical spectrometers –

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.070
to calibration systems for
pressure and humidity.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.020
We can help in validating
your measuring equipment, –

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.220
or when, for example,
developing a measuring system –

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.120
or process for
quality control.
