00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.140
The world needs alternatives to
fossil-based raw materials and energy, –

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:16.070
and new recycling technologies
for eliminating plastic waste.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.000
VTT Bioruukki Pilot Centre
offers unique expertise, –

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.080
modelling and piloting capabilities.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.150
In thermochemical
conversions we create fuels –

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.040
and chemicals from waste
streams such as plastics, –

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.130
and our process chemistry expertise
adds value to the demanding products.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:50.130
In hydrometallurgy we focus on
sustainable recovery of rare metals.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.090
We also work with biomass processing
for bio-based raw materials, –

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.190
and with the production of recycled
and cellulose-based textile fibres.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.050
Both start-ups and large companies
can benefit from our research –

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.070
and scale-up capabilities to turn technology
concepts into new business opportunities.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.030
At Bioruukki, we turn visions into
solutions for a low-carbon future.
