WEBVTT

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.680
We focus on Industry 4.0 and beyond.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.520
The costs and benefits of a product
are realised during its lifecycle.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.120
80% of them are locked in by
decisions made in the design phase.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.240
How can we design for
maximum lifecycle value?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.920
Industry beyond 4.0 enables
a fact-based, –

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.400
data-driven
collaborative approach.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.240
VTT provides tools for
reliable decision-making –

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.640
to produce durable products.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.040
We help to foresee
critical stages in product use.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.440
We support product design
for extreme conditions.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.600
VTT ProperTune is a multiscale
materials modeling –

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.600
and integrated computational
materials engineering concept –

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.360
and a software toolset.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.360
It enables you to
discover new materials, –

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.200
improve the performance
of the existing ones, –

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.400
optimise material solutions, –

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.000
or just troubleshoot
complex material problems.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.880
Customers benefit in terms of
the performance of their products, –

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.000
the pace of R&D accelerates, –

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.000
and in terms of the
associated costs.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.360
Typically you solve problems
related to material discovery, –

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.240
so totally new materials, –

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.000
optimization and systematic design
of material solutions –

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.440
to a specific product, –

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.800
or you address complex material
challenges in your products.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.520
For example, if you need to
avoid failure at all costs –

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.720
in safety critical cases.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.240
It's extremely relevant for the
industry that we work on –

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.800
real business cases,
real industry problems.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.120
ProperTune is not just
a modelling exercise, –

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.080
materials modelling and digitalization
have a critical role.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Materials are everywhere.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.480
Anyone who has an innovation,
value-chain or business model –

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.400
where there's significance in terms of
the material, the material solution, –

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.000
or the product is dependent on
material characteristics, –

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.800
that's a huge case for
VTT ProperTune.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.200
With the new product lifecycle
approach we can: –

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.200
support resource sufficiency, –

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.360
shorten time-to-market, –

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.680
prolong product lifecycles by
applying fact-based design.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.000
Industrial renewal requires
new thinking.
