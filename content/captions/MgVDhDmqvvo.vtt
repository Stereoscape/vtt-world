00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.180
We are living in a digital world –

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.000
with more connected devices
and more wireless data to share.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.200
This requires reliable connectivity, –

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.240
new and higher frequencies –

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.100
and precise sensor systems.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.150
We at VTT have a unique team –

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.000
with extensive knowledge about
millimetre wave technology, –

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.160
RF solutions and antennas –

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.140
for use in autonomous systems and robotics, –

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.040
wireless communications,
public safety and healthcare.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.240
Our work, ranging from customers’
early phase research & development –

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.150
to final product optimisations,
can be seen everywhere around us, –

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.120
from personal apps monitoring health –

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.030
to phones, cars, radars,
drones, flight systems –

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.200
and even space missions.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.110
Our world-class Millilab, –

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.060
a European Space Agency External
Laboratory on millimetre waves, –

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.080
contributes to European space programmes –

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.130
and the competitiveness
of the European space industry.
