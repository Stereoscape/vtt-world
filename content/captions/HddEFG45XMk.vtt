00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.100
Diagnostics for improved quality of life,
work, health and well-being.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.080
Roll to roll manufactured diagnostics
is a technology platform which –

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.030
integrates printed electronics
and biosensors.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.230
Printed functionality means
integration of electronics –

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.180
directly to flexible
and stretchable surfaces.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.240
These platforms can bring diagnostics
from central laboratories –

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.010
to point of care locations
or even to homes.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.030
Elastic wearable platforms enable
continuous unobtrusive diagnostics –

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.020
during the stay at the hospital,
or during sports or every day life.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.070
We can solve existing diagnostics
manufacturing challenges.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.020
We can also create entirely new
products and production concepts –

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.264
utilizing our exceptional
R&D infrastructure, pilot factory, –

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.220
and highly skilled
professionals –

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.170
working in an international
cooperation network.
