00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:10.150
Film casting or the application of coating
can be performed in multiple ways, –

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.230
e.g. using slot die
or a foam applicator.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.040
In nanocellulose film casting,
the material is evenly coated –

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.100
on plastic substrate with
controlled spreading and adhesion.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.160
The texture of the plastic base surface
is replicated to the nanocellulose film, –

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.240
making it very smooth.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:44.050
The shrinkage is efficiently prevented
by film adhering to the plastic substrate, –

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.130
while the moisture is carefully
evaporated with driers.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.190
The pilot line is modular,
consisting of several drying units –

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.020
with variable drying performance.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.080
After drying, the nanocellulose film
is delaminated from the plastic support –

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.160
and can be transferred into a roll.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.220
Nanocellulose films manufactured on the pilot
line have potential as barrier materials –

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.030
in food packaging or as a
substrate for printed electronics.
