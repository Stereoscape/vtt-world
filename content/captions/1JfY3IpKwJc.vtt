WEBVTT

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.548
At VTT, we have close to 200
in-house experts designing, –

00:00:08.548 --> 00:00:12.881
developing and manufacturing
state-of-the-art microsystems –

00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:17.284
using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and
surface micromachining technologies.

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:21.643
At Micronova, we innovate
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), –

00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:25.998
such as micromachined piezo-actuated
mirrors and ultrasound sensors, –

00:00:25.998 --> 00:00:30.367
photonic integrated circuits (PIC) and
monolithic microwave integrated circuits, –

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:34.722
as well as custom CMOS,
post-CMOS services, –

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:39.085
and application specific
integrated circuits (ASIC).

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:45.721
We integrate these into functional
systems and products, –

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:53.637
serving customers from
different industry segments.
