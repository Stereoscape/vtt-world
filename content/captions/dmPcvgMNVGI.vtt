00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:10.140
Quality beer is one of
the great pleasures in life.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.050
However, our relationship with beer is changing.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.100
We are looking for new
flavours, and expect beer –

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.010
to support our healthy lifestyles.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.060
Also, we want our beer
to be produced sustainably.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.110
At VTT, we develop flavourful,
low-alcohol beers –

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.020
using new and improved yeast strains.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.070
We can select the
best microorganisms –

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.120
from our culture collection
of over 6500 strains, –

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.240
and develop methods for detecting
and controlling harmful microorganisms.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:05.040
Our pilot brewing facilities enable
us to cover all steps of the process, –

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.090
from malting to brewing, and strain
development to fermentation.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.140
Together with our partners, our passion
for beer and innovation help us –

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.190
develop new, safe and sustainable
brewing technologies –

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.100
to meet the challenges of the modern brewery.
