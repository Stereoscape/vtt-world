00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.760
How to turn plastic waste into profit?

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.200
Or replace fossil fuels with renewables?

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.400
VTT’s thermochemical conversion platform
helps develop processes –

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.360
that transform waste and biomass
into sustainable materials:

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.240
advanced fuels, chemicals and plastics.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.760
Our unique piloting facilities for
gasification and pyrolysis –

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.800
support waste- and bio-based
innovations from lab to pilot scale.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.960
We combine expertise
in thermochemical conversion, –

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.040
catalysis, process simulation
and evaluation, –

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.560
and process development to help
customers commercialise innovations.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.120
Computational modelling is used
to support process scale-up.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.400
We create sustainable processes
that yield high material efficiency.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.320
VTT’s multidisciplinary expert team
has a track record since the 1980s –

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.360
in helping industrial customers turn
waste and sidestreams into value.
