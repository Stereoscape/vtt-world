In addition to these, we provide interfaces to other technologies in e.g. materials science, probabilistic methods, civil engineering, instrumentation and control. VTT solutions include experimental and computational approaches and analysis, e.g. impact tests for impact-loaded reinforced concrete structures and the Apros environment for computational nuclear safety analysis.

Our unique piloting platforms for gasification and pyrolysis support waste- and bio-based innovations from lab to pilot scale. Our gasification pilot turns waste and residue streams into product gas and through novel gas cleaning further into ultra-purified synthesis gas. Synthesis gas is converted into renewable fuel or chemicals in our mobile synthesis unit. Our pyrolysis converts challenging waste streams into pyrolysis liquids to replace fossil fuels and chemicals. We combine expertise in thermochemical conversion, catalysis, process development and techno-economic evaluation to support customers in commercializing innovations.",
